# API Security Requirements

---

## API Overview
This document outlines the security requirements for the TfL API, focusing on mitigating risks related to unauthorised access, data integrity, confidentiality, and availability.

---

## Key Security Considerations

### 1. Authentication and Authorisation
- Use **OAuth 2.0** for secure access and token management.
- Implement **API keys** securely for programmatic access.
- Apply **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** to restrict access based on user roles.

### 2. Data Encryption
- Use **TLS/SSL** to encrypt communications.
- Encrypt stored data using **AES-256**.
- Avoid storing sensitive data in plain text.

### 3. Input Validation and Sanitisation
- Validate all inputs and check for allowed values.
- **Sanitise** inputs to prevent malicious code.
- Implement rate limiting to prevent DoS attacks.

### 4. API Request and Response Handling
- Set **secure headers** like `Content-Security-Policy`.
- Use generic error messages to protect sensitive information.
- Limit returned data to avoid excessive exposure.

### 5. Logging and Monitoring
- Log all API requests and monitor for anomalies.
- Set up automated alerts for potential security breaches.

## Conclusion
Following these security guidelines will ensure the TfL API remains secure, mitigating risks related to unauthorised access, data breaches, and confidentiality issues.
