# API Security Requirements

## **API Overview**
This document outlines the security requirements for the TfL (Transport for London) API, which enables data sharing, scraping, and connectivity between Python programs and various data formats, such as XML, JSON, and SQL. The aim is to mitigate risks related to unauthorised access, data integrity, confidentiality, and availability when accessing TfL data for transportation services.

## **Key Security Considerations**

### 1. **Authentication and Authorisation**
   - **Objective**: Ensure only authenticated and authorised users or systems can access TfL’s API endpoints.
   - **Requirements**:
     - **OAuth 2.0**: Implement OAuth 2.0 as the primary authentication mechanism to ensure secure access. This protocol is essential for managing tokens and user sessions securely.
     - **API Keys**: TfL’s API currently supports API keys, which should be used for programmatic access. Keys must be handled securely and should not be hardcoded in Python scripts.
     - **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Restrict access to specific API endpoints based on the user’s role. For example, certain endpoints might only be accessible to administrative users.

### 2. **Data Encryption**
   - **Objective**: Ensure the confidentiality and integrity of data during transfer and at rest.
   - **Requirements**:
     - **TLS/SSL**: Use TLS (Transport Layer Security) to encrypt all communications between the Python client and the TfL API. This protects sensitive data from being intercepted.
     - **Encryption at Rest**: Sensitive information retrieved from the TfL API and stored in local databases (e.g., SQL databases) must be encrypted using industry-standard encryption algorithms such as AES-256.
     - **Avoid Storing Sensitive Data**: Avoid storing sensitive data in plain text within files, JSON, or XML structures unless it is absolutely necessary and encrypted.

### 3. **Input Validation and Sanitisation**
   - **Objective**: Protect the API from common vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).
   - **Requirements**:
     - **Input Validation**: Ensure that all input from users or external sources is validated. Input such as parameters passed to the API should be checked for allowed values and formats.
     - **Sanitise Input**: Strip out any malicious code or harmful characters in user input. This is especially important when dealing with data sent in XML or JSON formats.
     - **Limit API Requests**: Implement rate limiting to prevent Denial of Service (DoS) attacks or excessive scraping that could degrade API performance.

### 4. **API Request and Response Handling**
   - **Objective**: Ensure that API responses are handled securely and protect users from potential vulnerabilities.
   - **Requirements**:
     - **Secure Headers**: Set appropriate HTTP headers, such as `Content-Security-Policy` and `Strict-Transport-Security`, to enhance security in data exchanges.
     - **Error Handling**: Ensure that error messages do not expose sensitive information (e.g., API keys, system details). Use generic error messages to prevent attackers from learning system behaviours.
     - **Pagination and Limits**: Limit the number of records returned in responses to avoid overwhelming the API or leaking large volumes of sensitive data.

### 5. **Logging and Monitoring**
   - **Objective**: Detect and respond to suspicious activities on the API.
   - **Requirements**:
     - **Log API Requests**: Implement logging for all API requests, including user actions, failed login attempts, and API key usage. These logs should be stored securely.
     - **Monitor for Anomalies**: Continuously monitor logs for unusual or suspicious activities, such as repeated failed attempts to access endpoints.
     - **Alerting**: Set up automated alerts for potential security breaches or unusual traffic patterns, allowing rapid response to attacks or misuse.

## **Conclusion**
Implementing the above security requirements will help ensure that the TfL API remains secure when sharing data, enabling scraping, and ensuring connectivity between Python programs and various data formats. This specification mitigates risks related to unauthorised access, data integrity breaches, and confidentiality issues.
