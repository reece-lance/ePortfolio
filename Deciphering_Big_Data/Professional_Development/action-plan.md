# Action Plan

To build on the skills developed during the **Deciphering Big Data** module, my action plan focuses on advancing my technical and strategic capabilities:

- **Deepen API Security Expertise**: I will further explore API security, particularly focusing on advanced topics like token management, encryption protocols, and authentication mechanisms through resources like OWASP.
- **Enhance Database Optimisation**: To improve performance with larger datasets, I will study indexing strategies and best practices for database optimisation, ensuring scalability and efficiency in future projects.
- **Stay Updated on Data Regulations**: I will continue to monitor evolving data protection regulations, especially GDPR and ICO guidelines, to stay informed about the latest compliance requirements for data security and privacy.
- **Develop Machine Learning Skills**: Expanding my knowledge in machine learning will allow me to handle more complex data problems and contribute to predictive analytics tasks, which are key in data science.
- **Improve Team Leadership**: Building on the leadership experience gained during the TfL project, I will seek opportunities to lead small projects and continue developing my ability to manage teams in a professional setting.
