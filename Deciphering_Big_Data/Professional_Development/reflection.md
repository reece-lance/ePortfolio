# Reflective Piece

The **“Deciphering Big Data”** module has been instrumental in shaping my understanding of the complexities involved in managing and processing large datasets. This reflection outlines how my experiences across the various tasks and collaborative discussions have contributed to my personal and professional growth, and how I can apply these insights in future roles.

## Development of Technical Skills

Throughout the module, I have refined my technical skills, particularly in data wrangling and processing. A significant portion of the coursework required critical thinking in choosing appropriate methodologies and tools to address complex problems, especially during the **TfL Database Design Project**. The data management pipeline I designed and implemented using Python involved retrieving, cleaning, and preparing large volumes of data for database integration. The challenges encountered in this project, such as handling different file formats and cleaning datasets for compatibility with the DBMS, have improved my proficiency in Python, particularly in using libraries like `pandas` for efficient data manipulation.

Moreover, normalisation tasks have expanded my understanding of relational database design principles, such as organising data into **Third Normal Form (3NF)** to ensure data integrity and eliminate redundancy. Prior to this module, my knowledge of database design was limited, but the hands-on practice of implementing **primary and foreign keys** and testing referential integrity with cascading deletes has given me the confidence to apply these skills in future database-related projects. The **feedback** I received on these tasks, especially the suggestion to implement indexing for better performance, has highlighted the importance of continuously seeking optimisation in real-world datasets that can grow substantially over time.

## Collaborative Learning and Teamwork

The collaborative nature of the module was crucial to my growth. The **discussion on IoT in smart cities** was particularly enlightening. Initially, I focused on the technical advantages of IoT integration, such as improving urban efficiency and sustainability. However, through peer feedback, I was prompted to explore the socio-technical implications more deeply, particularly privacy and security concerns. The suggestion to include real-world case studies, such as Singapore's **Smart Nation initiative**, demonstrated the importance of grounding technical arguments in practical applications. This feedback prompted me to take a more holistic view of technology, recognising that while innovation drives progress, it must be balanced with careful consideration of security and ethical issues.

Similarly, the collaborative discussion on **compliance laws**, comparing GDPR with the ICO guidelines, sharpened my awareness of the evolving nature of data protection standards. The detailed peer insights on the limitations of anonymisation, combined with real-world examples of re-identification, enhanced my understanding of data security challenges in the context of modern technologies like AI. The reflection on **how organisations should consider encryption over anonymisation** as a long-term strategy provided me with a clearer approach to future data security projects. This shift in perspective, from a purely technical to a strategic viewpoint, represents a significant personal and professional development in my understanding of the regulatory landscape.

## Reflection on Problem-Solving and Critical Thinking

The tasks involving **data cleaning and processing**, particularly the work on the **Unicef dataset**, were pivotal in developing my problem-solving skills. With over 9,000 rows and 159 columns, the dataset presented significant challenges related to missing values, duplicates, and column mismatches. By working through these obstacles systematically, I gained confidence in my ability to manage and clean large datasets effectively. The process of normalising numeric data and sanitising column names for SQLite compatibility required attention to detail and a strong grasp of database requirements. This task, combined with the development of a **SQLite database**, solidified my practical understanding of how to structure and clean data in preparation for analysis.

A key takeaway from this experience is the realisation that **data cleaning is something to be taken care of in order to get the results you desire**. The decisions I made regarding which cleaning techniques to use—whether forward-filling missing values or replacing them with column means—illustrated the subjective nature of data processing. This has encouraged me to approach data cleaning with more critical thinking, always considering the context of the dataset and the potential downstream impact of each decision.

## Application of Learning in Professional Contexts

The skills and knowledge acquired in this module are directly applicable to my professional aspirations in the field of data science. The focus on **API security**, particularly in the context of the TfL project, has broadened my understanding of the critical role security plays in data management. The practical exploration of OAuth 2.0, encryption protocols like **TLS/SSL**, and input validation techniques highlighted the importance of safeguarding sensitive data, especially when dealing with public APIs. The insights gained from this project have not only increased my technical proficiency in API integration but also instilled a mindset of **security-first thinking**, which will be essential in any future data-driven role.

Furthermore, the ability to **coordinate and communicate effectively within a team**, as demonstrated in the TfL project, has been a key learning outcome. My role in initiating communication channels, assigning tasks, and managing timelines ensured that our project stayed on track. This experience has reaffirmed the importance of clear and consistent communication in a virtual professional environment, a skill that will be invaluable as I progress in my career.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the **Deciphering Big Data** module has provided me with a comprehensive foundation in data management, security, and team collaboration. The technical, analytical, and collaborative skills I have developed will be essential as I transition into more advanced roles in the data science field. This module has not only equipped me with the tools to manage large datasets and ensure data security but also fostered a mindset of continuous learning and improvement, which will guide my professional journey moving forward.
