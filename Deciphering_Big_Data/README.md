# Deciphering Big Data

---

## Module Overview

The "Deciphering Big Data" module focuses on developing the skills necessary to manage and analyse large datasets, including identifying and mitigating challenges, risks, and security issues associated with data wrangling. It also covers designing and developing solutions using appropriate methodologies, tools, and techniques for processing datasets in various environments.

## Learning Outcomes

1. Identify and manage challenges, security issues, and risks in data wrangling.
2. Critically analyse data wrangling problems and determine appropriate methodologies, tools, and techniques.
3. Design, develop, and evaluate solutions for processing datasets and solving complex problems using relevant programming paradigms.
4. Develop and implement the skills required to be an effective member of a development team in a virtual professional environment.

### Action Plan

To build on the skills developed during the **Deciphering Big Data** module, my action plan focuses on advancing my technical and strategic capabilities:

- **Deepen API Security Expertise**: I will further explore API security, particularly focusing on advanced topics like token management, encryption protocols, and authentication mechanisms through resources like OWASP.
- **Enhance Database Optimisation**: To improve performance with larger datasets, I will study indexing strategies and best practices for database optimisation, ensuring scalability and efficiency in future projects.
- **Stay Updated on Data Regulations**: I will continue to monitor evolving data protection regulations, especially GDPR and ICO guidelines, to stay informed about the latest compliance requirements for data security and privacy.
- **Develop Machine Learning Skills**: Expanding my knowledge in machine learning will allow me to handle more complex data problems and contribute to predictive analytics tasks, which are key in data science.
- **Improve Team Leadership**: Building on the leadership experience gained during the TfL project, I will seek opportunities to lead small projects and continue developing my ability to manage teams in a professional setting.
